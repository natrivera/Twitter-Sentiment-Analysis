""All these right wing shows"" is kind of a stretch. does Tucker Carlson advocate violence? Stephen Crowder? Jesus christ, Alex Jones doesn't even do it. Not like antifa, not like Maxiene Waters. Does ""when they go low we kick em"" sound familiar?"

Most of the time he talks he uses specious logic and ppl eat it up. He fuels idiotic ideology in ppl and some get pushed to far by it. So be careful and don't be caught up in terrorism.
