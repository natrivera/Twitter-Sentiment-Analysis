813,2018-10-30 23:22:48,0,0,Twitter for iPhone,103,1,I voted #ComeBackKobe on @TheTylt. He only needs one more ring to catch Jordan! https://t.co/k5J8fPrgNS

He had no guard skills at all and lacked the athleticism and strength to be the versatile defender Bron has been. LeBron is objectively more versatile on both ends of the court.

Examples
LeBron still the best season 16
Brady age 40
Adrian Peterson surely takes more hits than CAM
Your position that'll he wear down is based on older players that didn't have this type of Access to training and medicine #BAM"
