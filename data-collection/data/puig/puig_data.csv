But no one explains why on Earth he chose to pitch to Puig in 13th instead of walking him &amp; pitching to Barnes.
Right there he gave up the nearly certain win, &amp; set the scene for loss.

Kinsler will swing at me but miss.
Sale would throw at me, and Rich Hill would retaliate for me and Id be at the bar waiting for @thestreak19 to back me up."
